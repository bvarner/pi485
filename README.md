# pi485
RS485 over a Raspberry Pi UART? (Or Arduino?) You betcha.

So, you want to hook up your Raspberry Pi to an RS-485 bus? Fantastic.
This repo explores a few options. 
* Fully assembled, pre-built, performant, and reasonably priced commercial modules that need no additional circuitry.
* Assembled, pre-built modules which need additional circuitry for hardware TX support.
* Complete directions / drawings / dicussions of a build your own solution.

If you're working with Raspberry Pi's or Arduino's for the sake of learning, I strongly suggest we dispense with the first two options.

If you're more into results than learning what's inside a black box, you should pony up the cash for a [LinkSprite RS485 module](http://store.linksprite.com/rs485-gpio-shield-for-raspberry-pi-v2/), or a USB based alternative.
