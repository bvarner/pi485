# Pi485 Bearer Module

Based upon what I learned while creating the Standalone pi485, this board is meant to function as a carrier / bearer for an
[LC Technologies RS485 module](http://www.chinalctech.com/index.php?_m=mod_product&_a=view&p_id=811), adding the RX / TX LEDs,
power controll, and latched DE / RE pin driving to this very inexpensive and commonly available module.

Unlike the standalone board this layout prioritizes compactness over ease of use for beginners.
The trace clearances are tighter and you'll need to remove five surface mount resistors from the RS485 module. In practice, I've found 
these boards are reasonably easy to produce with a laser printer hot iron transfer.

# Design Goals
* Add the functions and features of the standalone module in a slightly more compact layout that can accomodate inexpensive 485 modules.
* Leverage the RS 485 module due to the module cost being less than the the cost of a discrete terminal block header, max485 IC, power LED, 
LED resistor, and filtering capacitors. These boards do shave a couple USD off the cost of UART based RS-485.
* Latch the DE / RE pins on the Max485 based upon the UART TX activity, but allow that to be disabled (force read-only mode)
* Include jumper termination for the A/B lines of the RS485 bus.

# Build Instructions

1. Start off by customizing the resistor values for your LEDs. I used [http://ledcalc.com/] to help inspire my choices.
2. Use KiCad's PCB editor (pcbnew) to customize any footprint changes.
3. Print the [back copper](plots/pi485bearer-B.Cu.svg) layer on a laser printer, using glossy photo paper.
4. Print the [front](plots/pi485bearer-brd.svg) layers on a laser printer, using glossy photo paper.
5. Cut your board (62mm x 30mm)
6. Transfer the copper printout using a hot iron and some water.... (youtube reference coming). Touchup with a resist pen if necessary.
7. Etch the board.
8. Clean the board.
9. Tin the board.
10. Reflow the board (bake it in an oven).
11. Drill the component holes.
12. Place & solder components.
13. Assemble!
14. Remove the 120Ohm resistor (R7), and the 4 10kOhm pull-up resistors (R1 - R4) from the LC Tech 485 Module.
